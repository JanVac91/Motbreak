# Capcom Resident Evil Outbreak - Animation Tools
## User Guide

## 🚀 GETTING STARTED

### Installation
1. Open Blender (3.0 or newer)
2. Go to `Edit → Preferences → Add-ons → Install`
3. Install both files:
   - `mot_importer_v1_8.py` (for importing)
   - `mot_exporter_v2_8.py` (for exporting)
4. Enable both add-ons by checking their boxes

## 📐 SKELETON SETUP

### Required Structure
Your character skeleton must have bones named exactly:
```
Node0
Node1
Node2
Node3
Node4
... (up to Node21 for human characters)
```

**Important:**
- Node0 must be the armature (the main object)
- Node1-21 must be bones inside the armature
- Names are case-sensitive!

### Project Settings
Before animating, set these in Blender:
1. **Frame Rate:** Go to `Output Properties → Frame Rate → 60`
2. **Rotation Mode:** Select all bones → Press `R` → Choose `XYZ Euler`

---

## 🎨 ANIMATING

### Basic Rules
1. **Root Motion (walking/running):**
   - Put forward/backward movement on **Node0** (Y location)
   - Put left/right movement on **Node0** (X location)

2. **Body Rotations:**
   - Animate **Node2-21** normally (head, arms, legs, etc.)
   - Use rotation keyframes

3. **Interpolation:**
   - For location (movement): Set to **Linear** interpolation
     - Select keyframes in Graph Editor
     - Press `T` → `Linear`
   - For rotation: Use default (Bezier is fine)

### Timeline
- Set your animation range in the Timeline
  - Example: `Start Frame: 0`, `End Frame: 120`
- The exporter will only export keyframes within this range

---

## 📥 IMPORTING ANIMATIONS

### Basic Import
1. `File → Import → Outbreak Import (.mot)`
2. Select your `.mot` file
3. Click **Import**

This will replace any existing animation.

### Import Options

**☐ New Action**
- Check this to keep your current animation
- Creates a separate animation you can switch between
- **When to use:** You want to import multiple animations (idle, walk, run, etc.)

**☐ Append Mode**
- Check this to add animation after your current animation
- Move the timeline cursor to where you want it to start
- **When to use:** You want to chain animations together (walk → run)

**☐ Ignore Face (0x06)**
- Check this to skip facial animations
- **When to use:** Your character doesn't have facial bones

**☑ Monster: First Section Only**
- Leave this checked (default)
- Prevents glitchy animations on monsters
- **When to use:** Always for monster animations

---

## 📤 EXPORTING ANIMATIONS

### Basic Export
1. Set your frame range in the Timeline
   - `Start Frame: 0`
   - `End Frame: 120` (or your animation length)
2. `File → Export → Capcom Outbreak (.mot)`
3. Choose where to save
4. Click **Export**

### Export Options

**☐ Enable Loop**
- Check this for animations that repeat (walk, run, idle)
- Leave unchecked for one-time animations (pick up object, open door)

**Loop Frame**
- Usually set to `0`
- This is the frame where the animation loops back to

## 💡 COMMON WORKFLOWS

### Workflow 1: Import a Game Animation
```
1. File → Import → Outbreak Import (.mot)
2. Select walk.mot
3. Click Import
4. Animation is now on your character!
```

### Workflow 2: Import Multiple Animations
```
1. Import idle.mot (normal import)
2. Import walk.mot
   ✓ Check "New Action"
3. Import run.mot
   ✓ Check "New Action"

## ⚠️ COMMON PROBLEMS

### "Character slides on the ground"
**Fix:**
1. Make sure Node1 has the Z location animation
2. Set location keyframes to Linear interpolation:
   - Graph Editor → Select location curves
   - Press `T` → Linear

---

## 📋 QUICK CHECKLIST

Before exporting:
- [ ] Frame rate is 60 FPS
- [ ] Rotation mode is XYZ Euler (all bones)
- [ ] Timeline range is correct (Start/End frames)
- [ ] Node1 has forward movement, Node2 the offset movement
- [ ] Location keyframes are Linear interpolation
- [ ] Loop setting is correct (on for walk/run, off for actions)

---

## 🎓 TIPS

1. **Test early!** Export and test in-game frequently, don't wait until the animation is perfect
2. **Name your actions** - Makes it easier to find animations later
3. **Use Linear for movement** - Bezier curves cause sliding
4. **Keep it simple** - Start with simple animations before complex ones
5. **Save often** - Blender can crash, save your work!

## 🆘 NEED HELP?

If something doesn't work:
1. Check this guide first
2. Look at the Console (Windows → Toggle System Console)
3. Make sure your skeleton has the correct bone names
4. Verify frame rate is 60 FPS and rotation mode is XYZ Euler
